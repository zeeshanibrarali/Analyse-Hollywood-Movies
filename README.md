# movie-budget-and-revenue-data-analysis
This dataset is perfect for trying out some new tools like scikit-learn to run a linear regression and seaborn, a popular data visualisation library built on top of Matplotlib. 

Do higher film budgets lead to more revenue in the box office? In other words, should a movie studio spend more on a film to make more? 

## you'll learn:

- How to use a popular data visualisation library called Seaborn

- How to run and interpret a linear regression with scikit-learn

- How to plot a regression a scatter plot to visualise relationships in the data

- How to add a third dimension to a scatter plot to create a bubble chart

- How to cleverly use floor division // to convert your data

## Learning:

- Use nested loops to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns

- Filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both .loc[] and .query()

- Create bubble charts using the Seaborn Library

- Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters

- Use floor division (i.e., integer division) to convert years to decades

- Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regressions over our data

- Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well the model fits our data and the r-squared metric

- Run regressions with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficients.
